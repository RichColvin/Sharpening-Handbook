Written by Guinness world record holder John Juranitch, it contains all the knowledge and insights gained during his more than 40 years in the sharpening industry. The 145 page book is crammed with photos, illustrations and cutting edge secrets you won't find anywhere else. Its 14 chapters cover topics like how to choose a knife, sharpening theories and applications, steeling, using a hone and much, much more. You'll get answers to the most asked questions. You'll learn the truth about common myths like why you should never use oil on a hone. And you'll get the insights necessary to put a great edge on knives, axes, fish hooks, arrowheads, chain saws and other tools. It's a history, a handbook, a reference manual that is the simplest, most complete way to give yourself a razor edge on sharpening.</td>

We will take a look on all of our &quot;large&quot; sharpening machines throughout history!  From one of the first prototypes, through the first real sharpening machine Tormek ST-250 from 1973, to where we are today with the Tormek T-8. We will also talk about our compact machines, starting with the Tormek S-1204 from 1992 to the Tormek T-4 of today, along with our kitchen knife sharpening machines

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Furthermore, we will go over some old marketing material, old jigs and packaging boxes and milestones in the Tormek history. In other words, this is a real smorgasbord for all Tormek enthusiasts out there!

In this sharpening class we show you how to sharpen a wide variety of outdoor and hunting knives, such as the skinner's knife, the hook knife and the pocket knife. We also show the sharpening of a small hatchet.

For some tools, such as  	&#x1f3bb; luthier knives,&#x1F52A; Kiridashi knives, v-tools, chip carving knives and Japanese plane irons, a completely flat surface on the bevel is preferred over a slightly concave, which you get when you sharpen on the rounded part of the grinding wheel. For some people this is more of a personal preference.

                    <p>We will discuss the advantages of the diamond grinding wheels and how you can use them to achieve razor sharpness on the hardest of steels. One advantage is that you never have to true the grinding wheel since it holds its shape. That also allows for sharpening on the outside of the grinding wheel to achieve a completely flat bevel on your tools.

                    In this episode we go through the basics of one of the most important parts of the sharpening process - honing. Honing your edge after sharpening will deburr your edge, which is crucial to get it sharp and durable. In addition, it polishes the edge to give cleaner cuts.
			
        			<p>But honing is also a means of maintenance for your edge between sharpenings. Many times, a couple of strokes on the honing wheel is all you need to get that razor sharpness back again. That will save both time and steel!
			
			        <p style="margin-bottom: 0; "><font color="red"><b><u>Key Note</u>:</b></font> At just past 18 minutes in the video, there are great microscopic pictures showing the effect of different grindstones on the ground surfaces.  This is a great comparison of the various Tormek grindstones, but also about typical bench stones and CBN wheels also.
