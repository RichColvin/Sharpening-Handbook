<h3>Ongoing Maintenance</h3>

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Clean the tool					 -->
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Be sure to remove all caked-on dirt and sap.  A well-kept tool will last your lifetime, and will still be usable by your children (and maybe your grandkids).

<p>I recommend trying to remove gunk mechanically first.
    <ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">A wire brush or putty knife can be useful for this.</li>
	
		<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">A green or purple scrub pad works well for removing many stuck-on materials.</li>
	
		<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Another recommendation is to use a product like Crean Mate.  That is a small block used for cleaning resin, rust, and other gunk from your tool.  It is recommended that the cleaning block be slightly wet.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Sap can be removed using a solvent.  The recommended products to try are ranked below:
    <ol>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 0; ">Isopropyl alcohol  works well, and is less harsh than many other options.</li>
		
	<li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 0; ">Acetone works well, but be sure to wear protective clothing as this is not kind to your body, and be sure the area is well ventilated.</li>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 0; "><span style="color: darkred;">Do not use petroleum distillates like lighter fluid.</span> This just leaves a gooey mess if there are any sugars on the tool.</li>

	<li style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; "><span style="color: darkred;">Do NOT use bleach or trisodium phosphate.</span> Both are oxidizers which will cause your tools to rust.</li>
    </ol>

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Exposure to Diseased Plants or Soil		 -->
<hr class="style2">
<h4>Exposure to Diseased Plants or Soil</h4>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">If the tool was exposed to any diseased plants or soil which is infected with pests, give it a quick wash with isopropyl alcohol.  Be sure to rinse with water and then dry afterwards.

<p>As noted above, the recommendation by some for using bleach or trisodium phosphate is not followed here.  Those products can damage the metal in the tool.

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Apply a thin coat of oil				 -->

    <p class="TextSMImage"><b><i>Camellia Oil Spray Bottle</i></b></p>
</div>

<h4>Apply a Light Coat of Oil</h4>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">After using any solvent, be sure to apply a thin coat of camellia oil to the tool.  I like the spray bottle of camellia oil sold by <a href="https://toolsforworkingwood.com" target="new">Tools for Working Wood</a>.

    <ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">In lieu of camellia oil, jojoba oil or cedar oil are recommended by some.  I've no experience with these, so I cannot recommend them.  And, as camellia oil is inexpensive and readily available, it is preferred.</li>
	
		<li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">There are some who advocate using olive oil as an alternative.  That is not recommended as olive oil, like all vegetable oils, are more attractive to dirt and dust, making a mess.</li>
	
	<li><span style="color: darkred;">Do NOT use boiled linseed oil (BLO).</span> Some advocate using BLO, but BLO often has heavy metals or other bad chemicals added for drying agents, and these are not good for you to handle, nor would they be good for the plants on which you might use this tool.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Tools in Storage</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Tools in storage need a thin coating of camellia oil applied to all unpainted surfaces.
