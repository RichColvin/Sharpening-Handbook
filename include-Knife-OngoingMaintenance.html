<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ongoing Maintenance</h3>

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Clean the tool					 -->
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Be sure to remove all caked-on gunk.  A well-kept knife will probably last your lifetime, and will still be usable by your children.

<p>I recommend trying to remove gunk mechanically first.
    <ul>
	<li>A green or purple scrub pad works well for removing many stuck-on materials.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>Another recommendation is to use a product like Crean Mate.  That is a small block used for cleaning resin, rust, and other gunk from your tool.  It is recommended that the cleaning block be slightly wet.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Severe problems may need to be removed using a solvent.
    <ul>
	<li>Acetone works well, but be sure to wear protective clothing as this is not kind to your body, and be sure the area is well ventilated.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>Isopropyl alcohol also works well, and is less harsh.</li>
		
	<br>
	<li><font color="darkred">Do NOT use bleach or trisodium phosphate.</font> Both are oxidizers which will cause your tools to rust.</li>
    </ul>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Apply a Light Coat of Oil</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">After using any solvent, be sure to apply a thin coat of camellia oil to the knife.  I like the spray bottle of camellia oil sold by <a href="https://toolsforworkingwood.com" target="_new">Tools for Working Wood</a>.

    <ul>
	<li>In lieu of camellia oil, jojoba oil or cedar oil are recommended by some.  I've no experience with these, so I cannot recommend them.  And, as camellia oil is inexpensive and readily available, it is preferred.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>There are some who advocate using olive oil as an alternative.  That is not recommended as olive oil, like all vegetable oils, are more attractive to dirt and dust, making a mess.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Tools in Storage -->
<hr class="style1">
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Tools in Storage</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Tools in storage need a thin coating of camellia oil applied to all unpainted surfaces.
