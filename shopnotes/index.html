                        </ul>
                    <br>
        	    </ul>
            <li><b>Camera for hollowing</b> - I recommend adding a camera to your hollowing system. I switched my hollowing rig to use a camera instead of the laser. That was remarkably easy, & I hooked mine up to an old, used computer monitor. Total cost <$50.
          	<p>What I used is :</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Camera :  <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/product/481586/MicroCam_720p_Security_Camera" target="_new">Swann Microcam 720p Security Camera, 1 megapixel resolution</a>. $25 @ Micro Center.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The camera uses a BNC Connector (a BNC cable and power plug come with the kit)</li>
                  			<li>The camera attached to the arm where my laser had been attached.  I hold it in place by a small hose clamp.  A small block of wood between the camera body and the hose clamp keeps it from pivoting on it's axis (from vibration in the woodturning process).</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>
                  	<li>Adapter (to convert the BNC cable from the camera to the VGA cable for the monitor):  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENH8MTW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"  target="_new">VGA video PC converter adapter with BNC</a> $18 @ Amazon</a></li>
                  	<br>
                  	<li>Standard VGA cable (usually has blue ends) - I already had an unused one</li>
                  	<br>
                  	<li>Computer Monitor  - I already had an unused one</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <li><b><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_new">Raspberry Pi</a> - a low cost shop computer</b>.  There are quite a few models of the Raspberry Pi, but I use the Pi 3 Model B+.  It has everything I need and the complete kit is around $75.</li>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.microcenter.com/product/506089/Raspberry_Pi_3_Model_B_Complete_Starter_Kit_-_16_GB_Edition" target="_new">Raspberry Pi Kit</a> from MicroCenter</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Computer keyboard with USB connection</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Computer mouse with USB connection</li>
              		<br>
              		<li>Ethernet cable (if you are hooking the machine up to a jack -- it has WiFi that you could use instead)</li>
              		<br>
        			<li>Computer Monitor</li>
              		<br>
          			<li>The Raspberry Pi uses HDMI for video output.  You may need one of these adapters, depending on the monitor you use.  If there is no HDMI input, then you'll need one of these adapters :</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moread-Gold-Plated-Projector-Chromebook-Raspberry/dp/B00SW9JI9A/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1529839979&sr=8-5&keywords=hdmi+vga" target="_new">HDMI to VGA Adapter</a> - usually the VGA cable has blue connectors on the cable</li>
                  			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-HDMI-DVI-D-Adapter-2-Pack/dp/B06WVSLSP3/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1529840081&sr=8-5&keywords=hdmi+dvi" target="_new">HDMI to DVI Adapter</a> - usually the DVI cable has white connectors on the cable</li>
