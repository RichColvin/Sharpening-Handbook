It is meant to mirror the value provided for machinists by
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_H._Colvin"  target="new">Fred Colvin</a> and Frank Stanley in <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Machinists%27_Handbook"  target="new">American Machinists' Handbook</a></u> or</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Erik Oberg and Franklin Jones in <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinery%27s_Handbook"  target="new">Machinery's Handbook</a></u></li>
    </ul>

<p>I like the technique shown in the picture from Biagio Pupini titled, <i>"Man supervising another sharpening an axe with a boy turning the wheel"</i> (a pen and ink drawing, circa 1535, and shown to the right); however I can't find the room for such a grindstone in my shop.  Also, my sons have moved out.

<p>Instead, I use the <a href="https://www.Tormek.com"  target="new">Tormek</a> wet grinder with associated jigs for sharpening when it makes sense to do so.  When it does not, I have noted that in this site.

<br>
<p>I have not used other systems like the the <a href="https://accu-finish.com/" target="new">Accu-Finish</a> or <a href="http://www.robert-sorby.co.uk/sharpening/proedge.html"  target="new">Sorby ProEdge</a> machines, so I can't speak to what would change using them.  If you have some information worth logging on this site, then please eMail me at the address shown below.

<p><IMG SRC="Images/info2.png" alt="no image file" style="width: 20px;" > icon:  For many topics, there is a link to information about recommended processes for the noted tools.  This is a quick overview.  If you are seeking information about how to sharpen tools, please refer to the <a href="indexResources.html">sharpening resources</a> noted on this site.  There are many others and they may be quite good.  I recommend these based on their proven approaches, and I have also found them to be safe when followed as instructed.

    Nothing will ever please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain the knowledge of it to myself. And if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse it. No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.

<p>Information presented here is given without any commercial gain.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm" target="new">God has been very good to me and my family</a>, and this is a way of giving back in a small way. I also choose to fund this web site privately so that the information won't be skewed towards any vendor, and so that it can be presented freely to those who would like to use it.

<p>If you have ideas or thoughts, please send them to me.  I want this to be a quick reference for sharpening, and notes that help make that faster or more effective would be greatly appreciated (and will probably be added).

<p>I have only shown information for tools I sharpen, or information given to me by others who sharpen their own tools.  If you have information about tools not shown, please do send them to me so they can be added.
    
<p>I've added a quote to each page with the hope of making you smile. Many ring true to me, especially those from old sergeants and old shop teachers.  None-the-less, if you are offended by one of the quotes, please do let me know.
