<!-- Ongoing Maintenance -->

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Ongoing Maintenance</h3>

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Clean the tool					 -->
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Be sure to remove all caked-on gunk.  A wire brush or putty knife can be useful for this.  A well-kept tool will last your lifetime, and will still be usable by your children (and maybe your grandkids).

<p>A green scrub pad also works well for removing many stuck-on materials.

<p>Some gunk may need to be removed using a solvent.  
	<ul>
		<li>Acetone works well, but be sure to wear protective clothing as this is not kind to your body, and be sure the area is well ventilated.</li>
		
		<br>
		<li>Isopropyl alcohol also works well, and is less harsh.</li>
		
		<br>
		<li><font color="darkred">Do NOT use bleach or trisodium phosphate.</font> Both are oxidizers which will cause your tools to rust.</li>
	</ul>

<!-- *************************************************** -->
<!-- Apply a thin coat of oil				 -->
<hr class="style2">
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Apply a Light Coat of Oil</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">After using any solvent, be sure to apply a thin coat of a light oil.
	<ul>
		<li>I like to use 3-in-One oil or sewing machine oil.</li>
		
		<br>
		<li>WD-40 is not recommended as it will evaporate over time, leaving the surface unprotected.</li>
		
		<br>
		<li><font color="darkred">Do NOT use boiled linseed oil (BLO).</font> Some advocate using BLO, but BLO often has heavy metals or other bad chemicals added for drying agents, and these are not good for you to handle, nor would they be good for the plants on which you might use this tool.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Tools in Storage</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Tools in storage need a thin coating of  oil applied to all unpainted surfaces.
